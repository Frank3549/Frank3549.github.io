Here you will find all of the files that i have used to build my website.

In their respective folder there are also different projects that are showcased on the website themselves and are fully working.


How to use:
1: Install extension "live server" to run a local version of this site.
2: Right click on "index.html" and click "open with live server". A new browser page with the site should appear.
